\section{On the Role of the Custodian}
\label{sec:custodian}
The role of custodians in our proposed system architecture remains integral but is substantially altered. While functions like record-keeping could be automated via the blockchain's immutable ledger, responsibilities such as risk assessment and compliance assurance still warrant human expertise. The blockchain's capacity for automating record-keeping may reduce operational costs and minimize manual errors, enhancing the efficiency of audits \citep{DTCC}. However, the custodian's role continues to be important in functions like dynamic risk assessments, which necessitate human judgment.

In terms of compliance, smart contracts may automate certain regulatory requirements but fall short in addressing the complexities of varying international laws or rapid legal changes. Thus, custodians act as a safeguard in ensuring all-encompassing regulatory adherence \citep{Thomson_Reuters}.

A new paradigm in custodianship may arise in this setting, characterized by a blend of automation and human oversight. While smart contracts could facilitate instantaneous asset transfers, custodians would retain a role in supervising the initiation and completion of transactions, particularly for handling exceptions or contingencies \citep{isda_transparency}.

This hybrid model of custodianship offers the best of both worlds: it couples the reliability of automated processes with the expertise of human oversight. For instance, a study from the conventional financial sector found that incorporating automated processes along with human supervision decreased transactional errors by nearly 30\% \citep{accenture}. In this context, smart contracts would handle routine operations like immediate post-trade collateral transfers, freeing custodians to concentrate on complex tasks such as liquidity evaluation and risk management \citep{deloitte_costs}. Consequently, this combination streamlines the initiation and settlement processes without compromising on the informed decisions that custodians contribute, resulting in a more efficient and secure trading infrastructure.
