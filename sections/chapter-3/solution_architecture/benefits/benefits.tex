\section{Benefits of Solution}
\label{sec:benefits}
 The benefits of implementing the proposed collateral management system are described in this section. We examine the advantages across four key dimensions: financial (Section \ref{subsec:benefits_financial}), economic (Section \ref{subsec:benefits_economic}), legal (Section \ref{subsec:benefits_legal}), and technological (Section \ref{subsec:benefits_technological}). From significant reductions in operational costs to improvements in market liquidity and efficiency, we outline how the solution aims to address existing challenges. We also explore risk mitigation strategies and how blockchain technology can aid in regulatory compliance and dispute resolution. Moreover, the chapter discusses the technological attributes that make the BSV blockchain a suitable choice for this application.
