\chapter{Solution Architecture}
\label{ch:solutionArchitecture}
This chapter delves into the system of collateral tokenisation on the BSV blockchain. The chapter begins by outlining the essential elements and overarching structure of the system in Section \ref{sec:components}. It then moves on to a detailed examination of how the ISDA's Common Domain Model has been adjusted to fit within the limitations set by BSV and sCrypt, with a focus on issues related to interoperability and taxonomy in Section \ref{sec:mapping}. Concluding the chapter, Section \ref{sec:flow_of_events} illustrates the steps involved in a typical collateral re-evaluation process, using a sequence diagram for clarity.
