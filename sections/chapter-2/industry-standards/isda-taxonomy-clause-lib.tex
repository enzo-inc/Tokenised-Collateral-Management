\subsection{ISDA Clause Library}
\label{subsec:clause_library}
The ISDA Clause Library \citep{isda_clause_library_factsheet} is an initiative aimed at providing clarity and consistency in the documentation of derivatives trade agreements. Recognizing the complexities and nuances inherent in these contracts, the library offers a structured approach to categorizing and defining standard clauses used in ISDA documentation. By doing so, it facilitates a more streamlined negotiation process, reducing ambiguities and potential misunderstandings between parties. The library serves as a reference tool, enabling legal professionals and contract negotiators to quickly identify and understand the implications of specific clauses. This systematic approach not only simplifies the drafting process but also aids in ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements.
