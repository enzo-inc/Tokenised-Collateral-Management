\chapter{Background and Preliminaries}
\label{ch:Background}
This chapter lays the foundation by covering essential background information and technical details. The chapter is organized into multiple sections, beginning with an introduction to financial derivatives in Section \ref{sec:derivatives}. This is followed by an exploration of the life cycle of derivative trades in Section \ref{sec:derivative_trade_lifecycle}, and a discussion on the complexities of collateral management in Sections \ref{subsec:collateral} and \ref{subsec:collateral_mgmt}. Section \ref{sec:industry_approach} examines established industry and regulatory frameworks, including the ISDA Common Domain Model and ISDA Create. The latter part of the chapter shifts focus to the technological underpinnings, specifically blockchain technology in Section \ref{sec:blockchain}. Here, we discuss smart contracts in Section \ref{sec:smart_contracts}, BSV in Section \ref{subsec:bsv}, and oracles in Section \ref{subsec:oracles}. The chapter wraps up with an analysis of the regulatory and legal considerations for tokenized assets in Section \ref{sec:asset_tokenisation}, as well as a review of recent scholarly and industry developments in Section \ref{sec:lit_review}.
