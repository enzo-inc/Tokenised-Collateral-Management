\subsubsection{Smart Derivative Contracts}
\label{subsec:smart_derivative_contracts}
One specific application of smart contracts in the finance industry is the emergence of "smart derivative contracts" \citep{clack2019smart}. Smart derivative contracts have the potential to revolutionize the derivatives market by embedding the terms of a derivative contract on a blockchain. These self-executing contracts can automate the life cycle of a derivative trade, from creating the contract, performing valuations, managing margins, and all the way to the final settlement.

When applied to collateral management in derivatives trading, smart derivative contracts can automate collateral posting and maintenance, which are often complex and resource-intensive processes. These contracts can be programmed to monitor the value of the collateral and automatically issue margin calls when necessary. The blockchain's immutability ensures that the smart derivative contracts are tamper-evident and their execution can be audited, thereby improving the security and transparency of the process. This use of blockchain and smart derivative contracts promises to transform collateral management, significantly reducing the risks, costs, and inefficiencies associated with the process.
