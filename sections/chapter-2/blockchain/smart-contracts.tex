\subsection{Smart Contracts}
\label{sec:smart_contracts}
The term "smart contract" was first coined in the 1990s by computer scientist and cryptographer Nick Szabo \citep{szabo1997formalizing}, long before the rise of blockchain technology, as we know it today. Szabo envisaged smart contracts as computerized transaction protocols that execute the terms of a contract, aiming to deliver highly efficient, automated solutions to contract law.

Today, in the backdrop of blockchain technology, the term "smart contracts" has become used to refer to programmable, self-executing, and self-enforcing protocols that run on the blockchain. They are essentially predefined rules and conditions encapsulated in the form of a digital contract. Once these predefined conditions are met, the smart contract automatically triggers a transaction or a specific action, making the whole process tamper-evident and leaving no room for default.
