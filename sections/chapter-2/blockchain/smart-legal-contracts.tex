\subsubsection{Smart Legal Contracts}
\label{subsec:smart_legal_contracts}
Taking the concept of smart contracts a step further are "smart legal contracts" – these are conventional legal contracts interwoven with smart contract functionalities \citep{ruhl2021smart}. A smart legal contract is essentially a legal agreement that has some or all terms and conditions represented and executed by software. These contracts are not only legally binding agreements but also contain provisions that are capable of being automated and carried out by a machine, providing the best of both worlds – the solidity of legal contracts and the automation of smart contracts.
