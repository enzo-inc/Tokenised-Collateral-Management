\section{Common Domain Model}
\label{app:cdm}
We omit the full Common Domain Model as it would be too large to include in a code listing in this document. We refer to the official \href{https://ui.rosetta-technology.io/#/login}{Rosetta Workspace} for the full type system (note that using this product requires creating a free account), presented both in textual form and through an easy-to-use graphical user interface, as well as the \href{https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/org.finos.cdm/cdm-typescript/5.0.0-dev.14}{official Typescript distribution} of the CDM to download the source code.
