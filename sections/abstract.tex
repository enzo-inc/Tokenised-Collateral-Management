\section*{Abstract}
The aim of this study is to address the operational inefficiencies plaguing the collateral management systems in financial derivative trading, which have far-reaching implications for market liquidity and efficiency. To this end, we introduce a blockchain-based solution that automates settlement and reconciliation processes, traditionally managed by intermediary clearing houses. Our methodology involves the creation of a tokenised collateral system on the Bitcoin Satoshi Vision (BSV) blockchain, adhering to industry standards set by the International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) and utilizing sCrypt, a Typescript-based Domain Specific Language to write smart contracts. A proof of concept tokenising crude oil as collateral is also presented. Our research reveals that while the BSV ecosystem is still in its infancy, greater collaboration between financial and tech sectors is essential for a seamless transition to a blockchain-based financial infrastructure. The study also sheds light on the technical hurdles in adapting existing ISDA frameworks to blockchain technology.
