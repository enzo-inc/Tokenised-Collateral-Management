\chapter{Results and Discussion}
\label{ch:resultsDiscussion}
This chapter offers an in-depth analysis of the outcomes associated with the proposed system for tokenizing collateral in derivative trading on the BSV blockchain. Firstly, we discuss how the custodian's role is transformed but still critical (Section \ref{sec:custodian}). We highlight the benefits of a hybrid model that combines automation through smart contracts with human oversight for tasks like risk assessment and compliance. Secondly, we examine the advantages across four domains: financial, economic, legal, and technological (Section \ref{sec:benefits}). This includes discussions on operational cost savings, enhanced market liquidity, regulatory compliance, and how BSV's capabilities align with the system's requirements. Finally, we address the legal aspects of tokenizing collateral, classifying our system as a hybrid model (Section \ref{sec:legal_considerations}). This section highlights how the system manages to meet regulatory requirements while also enabling direct interactions through smart contracts.
